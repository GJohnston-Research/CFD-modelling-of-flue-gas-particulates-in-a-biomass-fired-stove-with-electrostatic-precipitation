# CFD-modelling-of-flue-gas-particulates-in-a-biomass-fired-stove-with-electrostatic-precipitation
Using a description of a model, made by M. Conneely, in the paper "CFD modelling of flue gas particulates in a biomass fired stove with electrostatic precipitation". I have partially recreated the model (buggy) and with the permission of Dr K. Dastoori placed the unfinished model here at the end of my thesis work period. COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a with CFD module required to open.
